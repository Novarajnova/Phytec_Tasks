# UDP Chat System + OSI Model + Data Structures (C Project)

Project Overview

This project includes a **UDP-based chat system** written in C, demonstrating:

- üß† OSI Model concepts  
- üì¶ Basic data structure usage  
- üîÅ Event-driven state machine  
- üí¨ Command-line chat client/server over UDP

UDP Chat Application (Client & Server)

- Uses UDP sockets (`recvfrom()` / `sendto()`)
- Server broadcasts messages to all clients
- Client uses threads to receive while typing

How to Compile:
gcc server.c -o server -lpthread
gcc client.c -o client 

./server 9090
./client 127.0.0.1 username
